== Variations on Fibonacci Number Selections

.**(a fictional story)**

* Suppose your Product Owner requires a function that returns a list of
  all Fibonacci number less than _n_
* Who knows what a Fibonacci number is? ‚úã

[.notes]
--
* So I'm going to tell you a fictional story, not a true story, about a
  Python team that will develop functionality for a Product Owner
* And this Product Owner is representing the _Fibonacci Sequence Fan
  Club_
* And the PO would like you to make a function returning a list of all
  Fibonacci Numbers less than a certain value (_N_)
* ‚úã So, first of all, who knows what a Fibonacci number is?
--

== Fibonacci Number (definition)

[.text-right]
[quote, Wikipedia, "Fibonacci number"]
--
[.text-left]
In mathematics, the **Fibonacci numbers** [...] form a sequence, the
**Fibonacci sequence**, in which each number is the sum of the two
preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, [...]

[.text-left]
Starting from 0 and 1, the next few values in the sequence are:

[.text-left]
{empty}:: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
--

[.notes]
--
The definition from Wikipedia states:

* In mathematics, the **Fibonacci numbers** [...] form a _sequence_, the
  **Fibonacci sequence**, in which each number is the sum of the two
  _preceding_ ones
* So this is the _essence_, you start with two numbers, usually _zero_
  and _one_,
* and the next value is simply the addition of the previous two...
* So in this example, _zero_ is the first Fibonacci number, _one_ the
  second Fibonacci number, and the _next_ one, the third, is the sum of
  the _previous_ two numbers, _zero_ and _one_;
* zero plus one makes one, so _one_ is the third value of the sequence.
* The _next_ value is the sum of _one_ and _one_, which is _two_, and
* The subsequent value is the sum of _one_ and _two_, making _three_,
* Two plus three makes five; three plus five makes eight, and so on, and so on... and that's how the sequence is being built up

So let's implement that in Python.
--

== Fibs Less Than N (Python)

[source,python]
--
include::{sourcedir}/src/fibonacci/before.py[lines="1..8"]
--
* Source: `https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html`

[.notes]
--
A bit of Googling might bring you to Python's own documentation site,
  which contains an implementation of exactly this functionality. _This_
  implementation has another name, it contains type annotations and a
  docstring, but it's functionally equivalent

* First, you create an initially emtpy result list, and subsequently,
  two variables are initialized to the two first Fibonacci numbers
** You can see the variables `a` and `b` as _Fibonacci Registers_
** Register `a` holds the "current" Fibonacci number, and register `b`
   holds the "next" Fibonacci number
* You execute the loop body, as long as the "current" Fibonacci
  number is less than the provided threshold values
* Within the loop, you append the "current" Fibonacci number to the result
  list
* Next, you calculate the new values of the "current"
  and "next" Fibonacci numbers in one go, using Python's elegant feature
  named _sequence unpacking_. So the _new current_ Fibonacci number
  becomes the _old next_ Fibonacci number, and the _new next_ Fibonacci
  number, is the sum of the old two numbers.
* Finally, you return the result list
--

== Product Owner is happy and wants more

* Happy with the delivered result, the Product Owner asks for more
  functionality:

--
[quote, Happy Product Owner, More Features]
____________________________________________________________________
Can you also make a function that returns the _n_'th Fibonacci number
(counting from zero)?
____________________________________________________________________
--

[.notes]
--
* So your team demonstrates the functionality and the Product Owner is
  happy with the result.
* The PO now asks us to make a function that returns the _N_'th
  Fibonacci number, _zero based_,
* So Fibonacci number zero is the first Fibonacci number, Fibonacci
  number one is the second, number two the third, and so on, and so on.
* [He is just facilitating us programmers to make this zero based üòä]
* So let's code this new feature...
--


== The N'th Fibonacci number (Python)

[source,python]
--
include::{sourcedir}/src/fibonacci/before.py[lines="11..16"]
--

[.notes]
--
* As you can see, the code is similar to the previous function, but
  there are also differences: ...
* There is no list initialization; the function returns just one value
* You use the `range()` function to go the requested number of times
  through the loop body, but you don't need the counter value itself
* And within the loop body the new pair of Fibonacci numbers is
  calculated again.
* After the loop finishes, you return the "then current" Fibonacci
  number
* [show example with zero iterations, and with one iteration]
--


== Now the Product Owner really gets enthusiastic!

[quote, Very Enthusiastic Product Owner, Even More features]
--
Now that we've got functions for ...

* Fibonacci numbers up to N,
* the N'th Fibonacci number,
+
..., can you also make functions that return ...
+
* the first N Fibonacci numbers, and
* the smallest Fibonacci number greater than or equal to N?
--

[.notes]
--
* Now the Product Owner really gets enthusiastic and requests for two
  more Fibonacci related functions, ...:
* a function that returns the first _N_ Fibonacci numbers, and
* a function that returns the _smallest_ Fibonacci number that is
  greater than or equal to _N_.

[cols=2*]
|===

|`first_n_fibs`

|`fib_ordinal`
|`smallest_fib_greater_equal`

|===

* ‚úã We're seeing a pattern here, don't we?
* [next slide]
--


== The pattern

[source,python]
--
def some_fib_related_func(some_parameter):
    # (SOMETIMES: INITIALIZE THE LIST)
    a, b = 0, 1  # <1>
    while "some condition or otherwise a for-loop":  # <2>
        # (SOMETIMES: APPEND SOMETHING TO THE LIST)
        a, b = b, a + b  # <3>
    return a  # (OR SOMETIMES: RETURN THE LIST) <4>
--
<1> The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to their initial values
<2> Some `while` loop or `for` loop is set up
<3> The variables `a` and `b` are assigned their new respective values
<4> The desired calculated value, or a list of these values, is returned

[.notes]
--
The pattern: ...

* It starts with that sometimes, the calculated values need to be
  collected in some container, as `list` for example; this container
  needs to be initialized first.
* Then you see the familiar initialization of the two Fibonacci
  registers, `a` and `b`.
* Subsequently, some sort of loop is set up, counting, or with an
  end-condition.
* Within the loop-body, sometimes the "current" value is added to the
  container, and
* the new Fibonacci registers are calculated.
* Finally, the "current" Fibonacci value, _or_ the built-up container
  is returned.

Now that you see that the same code appears in different functions,
you start looking for ways to get rid of the apparent _redundancy_ of
code.
--


== Time to Start Refactoring Your Code

**(because you want to keep your code DRY{empty}footnote:[Don't Repeat Yourself -- Wikipedia: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself`])**
//**(because you don't like redundant code)**
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

‚ùì Refactoring ‚úã

[.notes]
--
* I don't know how you experience it, but I always get this itchy
  feeling if I see repetitions of code; you would like to keep your code
  _DRY_.
* So you start looking for ways how to refactor the code, extracting the common part into a function or method +
  {nbsp}
* ‚úã So who knows what refactoring is?
--

== Code Refactoring

* Restructuring existing computer code
* Keeping external behaviour the same
* Less complexity
* Improves ...
** ... design and structure
** ... code readability
** ... maintainability

[.text-right]
{blank} +
Code Refactoring +
{zwsp} -- Wikipedia

[.notes]
--
* So what's _code refactoring_ about?
* You restructure your code *without* changing its external behavior
* You usually do this to improve the design, structure, and implementation +
  (but you make sure that the original functionality of the code remains
  the same).
* Your code becomes *more readable*, *less complex*, *better
  maintainable*
--

== Extracting Common Parts Not Doable?

**(while trying to extract common parts of the code into a function: ...)**

* The code is entangled with control flow constructs -- `while` loops or
  `for`  loops
* Experiment: combine the requested functions‚ùì
** (by using a "mode" flag or an `enum` designating the mode)

[.notes]
--
* So it seems _impossible_ to factor those common parts out and put them
  in a separate, distinct function
* The code is mixed up with control flow constructs, `while` loop or
  `for` loops
* ... ¬ø_Maybe_ you could try to _combine_ the functions all in one golden
  "super" function?
* Let's start with trying the first two requested features, and we will
  use a "mode" _flag_ (a boolean) to designate which of the two features
  is requested...
--


== Experiment: Combine The First Two Functions

WARNING: Put on your Peril-Sensitive Sunglasses{empty}footnote:[https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Joo_Janta_200_Super-Chromatic_Peril_Sensitive_Sunglasses]

[source,python,step=1]
--
include::{sourcedir}/src/fibonacci/first_two_combined.py[lines="6..19"]
--

[.notes]
--
* Warning: what you see here, really hurts the eye; so put on your
 Peril-Sensitive Sunglasses...

{empty}[next click]

* As you can see, it starts already with the ugly return type
  annotation, and as the author of `Black`, ≈Åukasz Langa, told us in his
  excellent PyCon{nbsp}US keynote talk: "__ugly type annotations are an
  indication of ugly code__"
* So don't take this contrived example too seriously; it merely demonstrates that the resulting code is _not_ quite _maintainable_ and this isn't the way to go...
--


== Refactoring The Right Way: Single Responsibility

**(take a step back: think in terms of _responsibilities_)**

* The _common_ part between all functions:
** _Producing_ Fibonacci numbers
* The _mutually differing_ parts between all functions:
** _Consuming_ (further processing) the Fibonacci numbers:
*** collecting them in a container, or
*** waiting for a loop condition to occur, signalling it's time to
    return the last calculated "current" Fibonacci number

**how to separate the _common_ part from the _mutually differing_ parts?**

[.notes]
--
* The first step is to look at your code in a more _conceptual_ way...,
  * ... from a larger distance, a larger flying altitude
* And then you realize that there is a _data producing_ part in your
  code, ... the code that is calculating and providing the Fibonacci
  numbers
* And a _data consuming_ part, ... the code that
  _either_ stores these values in a container, _or_ is checking some
  condition that identifies the moment to return the "current"
  Fibonacci number.
* The _data producing_  the part that you can isolate.
--


== Context Switch: Generator Functions

* It looks like a normal function, but it contains `yield` expression(s)
* When called, it returns a _generator iterator_, implementing the
  _iterator protocol_
* Each plain `yield` ...
** produces one item
** saves the state of the generator function
** passes control back to the calling code
* When a new value is requested, the generator function resumes its
  execution from where it left off

* The _iterator_ can be used in a `for` loop, for example.


[.notes]
--
* Enter *Generator Functions*
* You just make a function, however you create a `yield` expression for
  each value that you would like to give back to the "caller" (the
  "consuming" party) +
{nbsp}
* So let's make a very basic generator function
--

* You see here an example of an basic generator function, mimicing
  the behavior of the `range()` function with an argument of `2`
* When called, it produces a _generator iterator_, that implements
  the _iterator_ protocol
* So if you call `next()` on it, it gives you the first value (`0`).
* another `next()` gives the second value (`1`)
* When you request another value, it raises a `StopIteration` exception,
  signaling that the iterator has no more value to give
* When used in a `for` loop, it also behaves just like any other
  _iterable_

So _how_ can you code a Fibonacci _generator_ function?
--


== The Fibonacci Number Generator

[source,python]
--
include::{sourcedir}/src/fibonacci/refactored.py[lines="7..12"]
--


[.notes]
--
* So this is how the Fibonacci Number Generator looks like
* [shortly explain the code of `fib_gen()`]
* What you see here, is in essence the "canonical" code representation
  of the Fibonacci sequence (when coded in an _imperative_ programming
  style).
* So how would you use this generator?
* [next slide]
--

== Example usage of the Fibonacci generator

Print the first 8 Fibonacci numbers using `fib_gen()`:

[source,pycon]
--
>>> for _, fib in zip(range(8), fib_gen()):
...     print(f"{fib:2d}")
...
 0
 1
 1
 2
 3
 5
 8
13
--
{nbsp} +

So now you can refactor the requested Fibonacci functions, making use of
this Fibonacci number generator.

[.notes]
--
* [Explain that `zip()` stops as soon as one of the iterators is
  exhausted.]
* Making the (by the Product Owner requested) 4 Fibonacci functions,
  has now become relatively easy.
* But we can go even one step further ...
* [next slide]
--


//== Nice Dependency Relation Between End User Functionality And Fibonacci Generator
//
//* The End User Functionality


== Are We Set? Problem Solved?

The next step: make use of the building blocks provided by:

* `itertools`{empty}footnote:[`https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html`] from the standard library, and
* the `more-itertools`{empty}footnote:[`https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io`/] external package.

[quote,"Python documentation, library","itertools"]
The [`itertools`] module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful by themselves or in combination. Together, they form an "iterator algebra" making it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure Python.

[.notes]
--
* ... because Python's standard library provides a wonderful module,
  delivering this functionality without needing to code any loop
  constructs yourself, the `itertools` module [read out the quote]
* what is called the "iterator algebra", is what I would call "a pipeline of iterators"
* *`more-itertools` implements the recipes listed in the `itertools` documentation and provides additional building blocks*.

* [First explain `dropwhile` and `first`] The ``itertools``' **``dropwhile``**
  generator filters away items from the passed __``iterable``__. For each item from
  the _iterable_, it calls the provided _predicate function_ with the item as its single argument, and as long
  as this function provides a "truthy" value, the element is discarded. Once the _predicate function_ returns a "falsy" value, it starts passing through
  the remaining items.
* The ``more_itertools``' **`first`** function just returns the first value
  of the passed __``iterable``__.
* [explain how the function uses these building blocks]

== A Lot of Useful Itertools

[.text-left]
* Check out the documentation of `itertools` and `more_itertools`
* A valuable collection of utilities to have in your toolbox

[.text-left]
_Just an Example:_

[.text-left]
* Using ``more_itertools.``**`chunked()`** (or **`ichunked()`**) to
  break an iterable into smaller parts.
* For bulk data - can be used to insert manageable sized "batches" of values
  into a database, for example.


[.notes]
--
* I encourage you to read through the documentation of the `itertools`
  module and the `more_itertools` package. It might probably save you
  some work if you have a good idea about the functionality it offers.
* It often makes your code more _expressive_ as well
--


== Recap

* Recognize the "pattern" of certain loop constructs as candidate for
  refactoring,
* Introduce _generator functions_ to _extract_ the "data-producing" part
* `itertools` and `more_itertools` might save a lot of coding
