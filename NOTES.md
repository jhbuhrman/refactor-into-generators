# Notes to Self

Here are some notes to self.

### Slide technologies:

- [AsciiDoc with slidy backend](https://asciidoc-py.github.io/slidy.html)
- [reStructuredText to reveal.js](https://github.com/LLNL/rst2slides) could be a great alternative!
    - See also [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)
    - But only **after** you're have finished your slides in AsciiDoc
    
### Good presentations
