# Notes to Self

Here are some notes to self.

### Slide technologies:

- [AsciiDoc with slidy backend](https://asciidoc-py.github.io/slidy.html), see also following additional resources:
  - [AsciiDoc User Guide](https://asciidoc-py.github.io/userguide.html) 
  - [AsciiDoc Language Documentation](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/)
  - [AsciiDoc Writer's Guide](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/)
- [reStructuredText to reveal.js](https://github.com/LLNL/rst2slides) could be a great alternative!
  - See also [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)
  - But only **after** you're have finished your slides in AsciiDoc
  - Node / JavaScript setup: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/reveal.js-converter/latest/setup/node-js-setup/
