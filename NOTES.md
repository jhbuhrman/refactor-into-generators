# Notes to Self

Here are some notes to self.

### State per 2022-04-15

- source doc is `refactor-into-generators.adoc`
- some RevealJS adaptions are in `rjs_settings.adoc`
- I'm using `asciidoc` (via `brew`) with the revealjs backend, as per
  https://docs.asciidoctor.org/reveal.js-converter/latest/setup/node-js-setup/ 
- I have an asciidoc plugin installed in PyCharm
- use `bash scripts/docbuild-rjs.sh refactor-into-generators.adoc refactor-into-generators.html`
  to build the resulting slide deck
- I have configured a PyCharm "File Watcher" triggering this command automatically on file save
